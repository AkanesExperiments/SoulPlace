This mod adds a single enchantment called <strong>Soul Place</strong> the enchantment places soul sand/soil from your inventory (Unless your in creative) and places it below and in front of you only placing where blocks are and dropping them (Note: this is meant to be used with soul speed and does leave a trail behind you)
